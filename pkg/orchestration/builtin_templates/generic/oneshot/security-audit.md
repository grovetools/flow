## Base Prompt (Security Audit)

You're conducting a comprehensive security audit of the codebase.

Examine the authentication and authorization mechanisms, data handling practices, API security, dependency management, and general code security practices. Look for vulnerabilities like injection attacks, insecure data storage, hardcoded secrets, and other common security issues.

Share your findings in a way that helps the team understand the security posture and what needs attention. Consider the severity of any issues found and provide practical recommendations for improving security.
