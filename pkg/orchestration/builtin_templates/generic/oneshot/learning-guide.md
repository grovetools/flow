## Base Prompt (Learning Guide)

You're creating a learning guide to help new developers understand this codebase.

Think about what someone new to the project would need to know - the prerequisites, core concepts, architectural patterns, and key workflows. Consider what would be most helpful for getting them productive quickly.

Share practical insights about how the code works, suggest hands-on ways to explore the system, and point out resources that would deepen their understanding. Make it approachable and progressive, building from basics to more advanced topics.
