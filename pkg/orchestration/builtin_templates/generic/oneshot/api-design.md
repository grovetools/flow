## Base Prompt (API Design)

You're designing a comprehensive API based on the requirements in spec.md.

Think through the API's purpose, who will use it, and what they need to accomplish. Consider the resources, endpoints, data models, and security approach that would best serve these needs.

Design the API with good practices in mind - consistency, clarity, proper error handling, and developer experience. Share your design decisions, endpoint specifications, and any important considerations for implementation and documentation.
