Continue the conversation by addressing the user's latest feedback or questions.

Guidelines:
1. Focus on the specific points raised by the user
2. Provide concrete, actionable refinements to the plan
3. If the user asks for more detail, expand on the relevant sections
4. If the user suggests changes, incorporate them thoughtfully
5. Maintain consistency with previous decisions unless explicitly asked to change them

Keep your response focused and relevant to the user's input.
