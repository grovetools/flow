## Base Prompt (Tech Debt Assessment)

You're performing a comprehensive technical debt assessment of the codebase.

Explore various aspects of technical debt - code quality issues, architectural problems, outdated dependencies, missing tests, documentation gaps, and infrastructure concerns. Look for areas where shortcuts were taken or where the code has evolved in ways that make it harder to maintain or extend.

Think about the business impact and technical risk of each issue you find. Consider what would provide the most value to address first, balancing effort against benefit. Share your findings and recommendations in a way that helps the team understand what technical debt exists and how to prioritize addressing it.
