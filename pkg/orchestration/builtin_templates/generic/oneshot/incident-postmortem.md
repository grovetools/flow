## Base Prompt (Incident Postmortem)

You're conducting a blameless post-mortem analysis of the incident described in spec.md.

Analyze what happened, why it happened, and how the team responded. Focus on understanding the contributing factors and system behaviors rather than assigning blame. Think about both the technical and process aspects of the incident.

Extract meaningful lessons and identify concrete improvements that could prevent similar incidents. Consider what went well during the response and what could be better next time. Share your analysis and recommendations in a way that helps the team learn and improve.
