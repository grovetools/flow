## Base Prompt (Test Strategy)

You're developing a comprehensive testing strategy for this feature or project.

Analyze the current testing landscape and think about what types of tests would provide the most value for this feature/project. 

Observe existing testing patterns in the codebase if they exist, and try to map these ideas onto the new feature.

For e2e tests, interactive capabilities are good. For example, bash scripts could walk the user step by step through the key functionality while they observe the behaviorer. In this way, our test become both a learning tool in addition to a testing tool.

Consider the balance between different test levels, what needs to be tested most urgently, and how to make testing sustainable over time.

Think about testing tools, frameworks, patterns, and practices that would work well for this feature or codebase. Share your recommendations for improving test coverage and quality, with practical examples where helpful.
