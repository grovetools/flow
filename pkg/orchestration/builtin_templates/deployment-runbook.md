## Base Prompt (Deployment Runbook)

You're creating a comprehensive deployment runbook for the application.

Think through everything needed for a safe, successful deployment - from pre-deployment checks through post-deployment monitoring. Consider what could go wrong and how to handle it, including rollback procedures.

Cover the deployment process, validation steps, emergency procedures, and key contacts. Include specific commands, scripts, and other practical details that would help someone execute the deployment smoothly, even under pressure.
