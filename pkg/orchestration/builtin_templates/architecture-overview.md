## Base Prompt (Architecture Overview)

You're creating a comprehensive architecture overview of this codebase.

Explore the project structure, key components, technology choices, and architectural patterns. Consider how different parts of the system interact, what design decisions have been made, and why certain trade-offs might have been chosen.

Visual diagrams can be helpful for illustrating system architecture and data flow. Create an overview that would help new team members quickly understand how the system is built and why it works the way it does.
