## Base Prompt (Performance Analysis)

You're conducting a comprehensive performance analysis of the codebase.

Investigate where the system might be slow or resource-intensive. Look at things like response times, memory usage, database queries, algorithmic complexity, and any other performance bottlenecks you discover.

Think about both immediate optimizations and longer-term improvements. Consider what monitoring would help track performance over time. Share your findings and recommendations in a way that helps the team understand what's most important to address and why.
