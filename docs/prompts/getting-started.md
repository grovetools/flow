# Getting Started Guide

Create a comprehensive getting started guide that walks new users through their first experience with Grove Flow.

## Requirements:

1. **Installation**: Briefly mention that `flow` is part of the Grove ecosystem and how to install it.

2. **First Steps Tutorial**: Create a step-by-step tutorial that shows:
   - How to initialize a new plan with `flow plan init`
   - How to add a job to the plan with `flow plan add`
   - How to check the status with `flow plan status -t` (showcase the TUI)
   - How to run a job with `flow plan run`
   - Basic troubleshooting tips

3. **Quick Example**: Provide a complete, simple example workflow that demonstrates:
   - Creating a plan for a specific task (e.g., "adding a new feature")
   - Adding 2-3 jobs with dependencies
   - Running the plan
   - What the output looks like

4. **Next Steps**: Brief introduction to:
   - Using different job types
   - Working with worktrees
   - Using recipes for common patterns

The guide should be practical, encouraging users to try commands as they read. Use clear, encouraging language appropriate for developers new to Grove Flow.
